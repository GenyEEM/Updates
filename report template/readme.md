It is possible to export EEM's test data to Excel files in the following common template formats. These can also be customised.
The three possible formats are as follows:
1. Batch listing of all meter test data
2. Individual listing of test data for a single meter
3. Customised output of meter test data

### CLP test report
The CLP test report will generate two files: one in PDF format and the other in Excel, which contains only the test data.
