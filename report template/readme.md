### General

EEM allows you to export test data to Excel files using several common template formats, which can also be customized. The three available formats are:

1. Batch listing of all meter test data
2. Individual listing of test data for a single meter
3. Customized output of meter test data

Feel free to let me know if you need further adjustments!

### CLP test report
The CLP test report will generate two files: one in PDF format and the other in Excel, which contains only the test data.
